# V-support

this was the First App Developed by me and my team by agile development model where we made and published this application within 3 Days of planning the application (50/72 Work hours).

The Idealogy & Stroy behind the Project :

In India, the govt banned some Chinese applications which they suspected of stealing data and not following their terms, Hence we saw an Opportunity to resent this emotion and develop an application that checked the package names of the banned applications and later gave an option to delete them along and offer the safe Alternatives which later makes a certificate/banner which can be share don social media by the user to promote the initiative.

While publishing the application we had to use distributed it via our blog page as the review process was long.
